**You:**

I wish to build an API wrapper in elixir that can wrap calls to gemini(google bard), huggingface, mistral, and openai models and user defined inference endpoints.

For some tasks like object detection it should be able to be called against gemini and openai, etc. by passing an image and a custom prompt telling the llm with vision to extract objects, etc.

It should provide a standard interface allowing easy switching between models when performing completions, etc.

I am open to interfaces changes  but I thinking something like.
````


   NAI.list_models(subject \\ %NAI{})
   NAI.provider(subject \\ %NAI{})

   list models:
   1. 
   NAI.provider()
   |&gt; NAI.list_models()
   2. 
   NAI.list_models()
   3. 
   NAI.list_models(NAI.providers([NAI.Gemini, NAI.OpenAI]))
   3. 
   NAI.list_models(NAI.Gemini)
  

   Overly Complex Example - chat completion

  
   NAI.transaction do # Loads 
       a = NAI.chat()
           |&gt; with_model(NAI.Gemini.Model.ultra) # optional will check configured defaults otherwise for action type.
           # |&gt; with_model(NAI.OpenAI.Model.custom(name: "ultraultra", ...)) # of we are manually defining a model or fine tuned model.
           # |&gt; with_model(CustomProvider.custom_model) # if we had a user defined provider
           # |&gt; with_model(NAI.Model.cheapest(params: :best_effort)) # if we want to pick the cheapest model at inference time based on context window, complexity, params. (will ignore params if they restrict a cheaper model.)
           # |&gt; with_model(NAI.Model.fastest()) # if we want to pick the cheapest model at inference time based on context window, complexity, params. (will ignore params if they restrict a cheaper model.)
           # |&gt; with_model(NAI.Model.smartest(for: :problem_type)) # if we want to pick the cheapest model at inference time based on context window, complexity, params.
           |&gt; message(system_prompt) # input is a message object or a lambda for deferred invocation.
           |&gt; message(user_message)
           |&gt; message(agent_response)
           |&gt; message(user_message_2)
           |&gt; tag(:base)
           |&gt; message(system_prompt_prepare_plan)
           |&gt; tag(:plan)
           |&gt; checkout(:base)
           |&gt; then(&amp; message(prepare_system_message_do_plan(NAI.ChatResponse.body(checkout(&amp;1, :plan)))) # syntactic sugar inline invocation and response extraction to add new message from message generated by previous thread at tag
           |&gt; message(&amp;NAI.ChatResponse.body/2, as: :assistant) # when executed will wait for response of thread and append additional message with output.
           |&gt; tag(:response)
           |&gt; message(system_prompt_reflect)
           |&gt; tag(:fin)
           |&gt; set_stream(true, required: true) # if dynamic model selection force this setting to be honored, ignore models with out support.
       b = NAI.ChatResponse.body(a) # if non stream fetch's objects completion field {:fin, x}
                                    # if a stream wrapper yields until some completion value available or request failure and returns {{:stream, tag, seq}, wip} or {:fin, x} or error
                                    # todo mechanism to fetch intermediates - e.g. stream and retrieve each tagged response after execution response, requires changes but here we'd want the output of the plan, response, and review/reflect   
       NAI.ChatResponse.yield(a, 5_000) # Yield till done or 5_000   
       {NAI.ChatResponse.done?(a), NAI.ChatResponse.tokens(a)} # all we return from this "transaction" is done flag and tokens so far.
   end


   Slightly Simpler Example - chat completion, no txn

   chat     = NAI.chat()
              |&gt; NAI.Chat.message(system_prompt) # input is a message object or a lambda for deferred invocation.

There is an additional feature/goal behind the scenes.   We will provide openai assistent like functionality by performing rag and compressing chat thread messages to fit in context windows. with additional api calls. Which we can then feed into chat completions and finally pick the best response to allow us to choose the best model picks + rag process + compression process. over time this will let use refine and improve the flow/steps and detect simulated agent response quality/tone/style divergence from baseline when we introduce new custom trained models/instructions for this process.

In a very advanced case a human operator may ask the system to produce a complete work (book, program, etc.) with some initial instructions. In parallel multiple messages b ack and forth between multiple agents can be run following optimal best step at each junk and presenting the top outputs to the user to choose from, their selection and reasoning can then be fed back into how we plan out those multi agent/system steps.

                                                     / Plan 1  ... ... ... Outcome 1
